        </em> </li>




      <p> <em>that city we call it the red city you will aks your self why ? <strong> i will tell you why </strong></em></p>
      <p><em>Marrakesh, a former imperial city in western Morocco, is a major economic center and home to mosques,
          palaces and gardens. The medina is a densely packed, walled medieval city dating to the Berber Empire,
          with mazelike alleys where thriving souks (marketplaces) sell traditional textiles, pottery and jewelry.
          A symbol of the city, and visible for miles, is the Moorish minaret of 12th-century Koutoubia Mosque</em></p>
      <li><em>
          <p style="color:#3db2c2"> Casablanca
        </em> </li>
      <p><em>Casablanca is a port city and commercial hub in western Morocco, fronting the Atlantic Ocean. The city's
          French colonial legacy is seen in its downtown Mauresque architecture, a blend of Moorish style and European
          art deco. Standing partly over the water, the enormous Hassan II Mosque, completed in 1993, has a 210m minaret
          topped with lasers directed toward Mecca</em></p>
      <li><em>
          <p style="color:#3db2c2">Rabat
        </em></li>

      <p><em>Rabat, Morocco's capital, rests along the shores of the Bouregreg River and the Atlantic Ocean.
          It's known for landmarks that speak to its Islamic and French-colonial heritage,
          including the Kasbah of the Udayas. This Berber-era royal fort is surrounded by formal French-designed
          gardens and overlooks the ocean. The city's iconic Hassan Tower, a 12th-century minaret, soars above the
          ruins of a mosque.</em></p>
      <li><em>
          <p style="color:#3db2c2">fez
        </em></li>
      <p><em>Fes is a northeastern Moroccan city often referred to as the country‚Äôs cultural capital.
          It‚Äôs primarily known for its Fes El Bali walled medina, with medieval Marinid architecture,
          vibrant souks and old-world atmosphere. The medina is home to religious schools such as the
          14th-century Bou Inania and Al Attarine, both decorated with elaborate cedar carvings and ornate tile
          work</em></p>
      <li><em>
          <p style="color:#3db2c2">Tangier
        </em></li>
      <p><em>Tangier, a Moroccan port on the Strait of Gibraltar, has been a strategic gateway between Africa
          and Europe since Phoenician times. Its whitewashed hillside medina is home to the Dar el Makhzen,
          a palace of the sultans that's now a museum of Moroccan artifacts. The American Legation Museum,
          also in the medina, documents early diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Morocco in an 1821
          Moorish-style former consulate</em></p>
